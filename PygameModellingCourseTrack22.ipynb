    "# Part II.: Agent-based Simulations in pygame\n",
    "\n",
    "[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) is a free, portable, highly optimized (in terms of CPU usage and multi-threading) game engine available via the main python package manager `pip`. `pygame` was originally designed to create videogames in an easy-to understand and open-source way. Many aspects and challenges of creating videogames, on the other hand, also apply to scientific agent-based simulations (e.g. parallel computing, speed optimization, highly object-oriented design). Next to providing an object-oriented and optimized framework to implement and simulate mathematical models, `pygame` also provides a unique way of interactive experimentation with the studied system via user interaction events (button press, cursor movement, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the provided code base\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our experimentation faster we have provided a code base including an implementation of the described Three-zone-model as a custom made python package called `pygmodw22` (**Pyg**ame **Mod**elling **W**orkshop 20**22**). The package includes a `setup.py` file that allows it to be installed via `pip` including all dependencies and version restrictions for the package. Inside the folder package `pygmodw22` you have 3 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **agent.py**: Includes the implementation of moving agents of the model as a single `Agent` class and the rules/methods of how a these agents' behavior is updated in each timestep (`update` method). Other than functionality, the `Agent` class also describes the appearance of the agents (color, radius, etc. `draw` method). Defining and drawing the agents is surpisingly easy compared to other animation methods (e.g. matplotlib animation library). This is one of the great advantages of `pygame`. Each agent class instance will include their own parameters (radius, zone parameters, etc.) hence `pygame` also makes heterogeneous system implementations easy compared to vectorized or non-object-oriented solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **sims.py**: In this file we defined the `Simulation` class that defines the arena (in which the agents move), possible user interactions, as well as the main simulation loop. This loop will have $T$ iterations and in each timestep it will call the agents' `update` and `draw` method (among other supplementary methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **support.py**: Includes all supllementary and mathematical methods needed for the update process. These are, for example, calculation of euclidian distance, implementation of the sigmoid function, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an example simulation, see the code below:\n"
