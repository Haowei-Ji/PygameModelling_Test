    "The following cell shows an example of using the code base to create a group of simpla brownian particles with pygame. The `Simulation` class creates an arena and N particles inside. We define the type of these particles/agents as \"brownian\". After initialization we set the noise parameters (defining the motion of each agent). The noise on the agents can be normal with parameters mean and standard deviation or uniform with parameters minimum and maximum value.\n",
