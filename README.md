# **PyGame Modelling Workshop 2022**

This is the offcicial repo of the pygame modelling course for collective systems workshop 2022 Berlin
pygmodw22 = **Pyg**ame **Mod**elling **W**orkshop 20**22**

## Welcome to the Workshop
During this workshop you will learn about using a python-based game engine (pygame) for agent-based modelling and simulation tasks to model collective behavior.
To use the provided code base you will need the following:

1. Operating System: The code has been tested on Ubuntu 18, Windows 10, and ...
2. Python: You will need to have a python version >=3.7.0. You can check the version of your python interpreter with `python --version`. In case your python version is lower than 3.7, please follow the following guides to install python 3.7 on Ubuntu, Windows or Mac.
3. pip: To install all the requirements of the code we will use pip. Please be sure to have a pip version for python 3+ (and not for python 2). You can check this with `pip --version`. The resulting line should end with "(python 3.x)" where x is the minor version of your python interpreter.
4. (optional) Virtual environment of choice: We highly recommend using a virtual environment for the workshop so that you don't have version mismatches with other projects. We recommend using pipenv or venv.
5. GIT: to access the code you will need git installed on your system. In case this is not yet done, please install it using the following guides:
6. Clone this repo: Open the terminal and use the following command to clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/mezdahun/PygameModelling22.git`.
7. (optional) Create new virtual environment
9. Install the provided codebase and it's dependencies: move into the newly created/cloned folder with 'cd PygameModelling22' and install the package with all it's dependencies using 'pip install -e .'
10. Test the installation by running an example simulation: from the same folder run the script test_installation.py as `python test_installation.py`. In case you have multiple python versions installed, be sure you are using python3.7 or higher.
11. At this point you are ready for the workshop! Happy coding!
